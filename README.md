## HELLO WORLD!!

My name is Isaac Harrison, a software engineer who invests some of my time to ensuring that I nurture my programming skills and abilities. I do this by dedicating some time to building fun and constructive personal projects which are always small scale, for now!

## WHAT'S THIS REPO FOR?

This repository is created as a personal repository to which I keep my C++ projects as I learn and become better at C++ programming. However, this repository can also be used by any other engineer learning C++ to looking for some projects in C++ to work on. You could see how these applications I build work and try to replicate them or add more functionality according to your liking. lol

Seek to explore your software engineering skills to become better. Let's goooooooo!!!!!!!!
