## WHATS THIS PROJECT ALL ABOUT?

This is a simple practice project in C++ to help me test my understanding of composition in C++. Composition is the practice of using data from a separate header file in another header file. That is the most simple definition I would have of the concept.

This is project is a simple project that asks a user some predefined questions about themselves and then stores the answers: "facts" about themselves in a class in a separate header file and using these facts in a separate header file to give out answers about the person as requested by a user.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED.

The only language used in the development of this project is currently only C++.
